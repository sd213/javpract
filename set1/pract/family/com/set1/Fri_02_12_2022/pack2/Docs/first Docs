What happens internally whenever we are compiling and running Java Program ?
A ->
    Whenever we are compiling through command Prompt (or) terminal (or) cli interface with writing
    " javac filename.java" ,the java compiler check  whether the program has any error .
    If no error is present inside the code , Compiler will generate .class file which consists of
    "bytecodes" and this generated .class file is only understandable by JVM. So then we have to run
    the Program with writing "java classfilename". If again no error is there , then the desired output
    will be show on the server.
